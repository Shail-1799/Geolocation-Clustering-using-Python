# Geolocation-Clustering-using-Python

Problem Statement:
We have taxi rank locations for Johannesburg, Sounth Africa and want to define key clusters of these taxis where we can build service stations for all taxis operating in that region.

Prerequisites:

Basic Matplotlib skills for plotting 2-D data clearly.
Basic understanding of Pandas and how to use it for data manipulation.
The concepts behind clustering algorithms, although we will go through this throughout the project.
